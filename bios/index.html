entertaining for the audiences but a kick " in the pants" to perform. I am also amazed that the 4 tremendously gifted musicians that complete the Jersey's have melded together to create this special experience . Musical theatre being my 1st love is where this Denver native started and aged locally . Most audiences recognize me from a almost 2 decade career at the Country Dinner Playhouse ( where I 1st performed with Klint, Brian and Randy) starting out as an actor and ending as the Producer/ Artistic Director. I am still involved in the Denver " theatre scene" performing and directing for Phamaly and at the Arvada Center, Pace Center and Lone Tree Arts Center. I am very lucky and blessed to call Penny my stunning wife and James and Becca my beautiful children. Paul would love for you to visit his website, but he can't even open up and read his email.</p><h2>Klint Rudolph</h2><picture>

<p>Quite a few years ago my Father took me to experience the Count Basie Orchestra from the front row at a local Seattle community college. I was only a few feet from Mr. Basie and could view all the interactions between the performers, and when the night concluded, I knew I wanted to be involved in some way with what they were doing. This resulted in tours on cruise ships in the Caribbean, Mexican Riviera, Hawaii and Alaska, and gigs as far as Hong Kong and Seoul South Korea where I spent substantial time performing with traditional Korean percussionists. I continue to perform wherever and whenever permitted, and I hope everyone around me is having a good time experiencing the music with me as a a performer and as an audience member.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="60"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="61"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="62"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="63"><span data-reactid="64"><!-- react-empty: 65 --><h2 data-reactid="66"><a data-reactid="67">The Jerseys - Colorado</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="68"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="69"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="70"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="71"></div></section></div></div>
